# Overview
The project illustrates the steps taken to process and analyze 24 historical documents. Several data mining algorithms were used to explain how the documents relate to each other
such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. Moreover, different dimensionality reduction techniques were implemented to visualize and better understand the similarities and differences of documents.
